#PSYC 259 Homework 2 - Data Transformation
#For full credit, provide answers for at least 7/10 (10/10)

#List names of students collaborating with: 

### SETUP: RUN THIS BEFORE STARTING ----------

#Load packages
library(tidyverse)
ds <- read_csv("data_raw/rolling_stone_500.csv")

### Question 1 ---------- 

#Use glimpse to check the type of "Year". 
#Then, convert it to a numeric, saving it back to 'ds'
#Use typeof to check that your conversion succeeded

#ANSWER
glimpse(ds$Year)

ds$Year <- ds$Year %>% 
 str_replace_all('"',"")


ds$Year <- as.numeric(ds$Year)
typeof(ds$Year)


### Question 2 ---------- 

# Using a dplyr function,
# change ds so that all of the variables are lowercase


#ANSWER
ds <- ds %>%
  rename(rank = Rank, song = Song, artist = Artist, year = Year)

#Mcomment: You can also do the below
ds <- ds %>% rename_all(tolower) #one option

### Question 3 ----------

# Use mutate to create a new variable in ds that has the decade of the year as a number
# For example, 1971 would become 1970, 2001 would become 2000
# Hint: read the documentation for ?floor


#ANSWER
ds <- ds %>% 
  mutate(decade = (10 * floor(year/10)))




### Question 4 ----------

# Sort the dataset by rank so that 1 is at the top


#ANSWER

ds <- ds %>% 
  arrange(rank)


### Question 5 ----------

# Use filter and select to create a new tibble called 'top10'
# That just has the artists and songs for the top 10 songs

#ANSWER

top10 <- ds %>% 
  filter(rank <= 10) %>%
  select(song,artist)
top10

### Question 6 ----------

# Use summarize to find the earliest, most recent, and average release year
# of all songs on the full list. Save it to a new tibble called "ds_sum"

#ANSWER


ds_sum <- ds %>% summarize(Average = round(mean(year)), Oldest = min(year), Newest = max(year))

#Mcomment: Looks good! In the key it also includes na.rm=T, though I know you dealt with in Q1 with the str_replace_all

### Question 7 ----------###year Question 7 ----------

# Use filter to find out the artists/song titles for the earliest, most 
# recent, and average-ist years in the data set (the values obtained in Q6). 
# Use one filter command only, and sort the responses by year

#ANSWER

ds %>% 
  filter(year == ds_sum$Newest | year == ds_sum$Oldest | year == ds_sum$Average) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  select(song,artist)

### Question 8 ---------- 

# There's and error here. The oldest song "Brass in Pocket"
# is from 1979! Use mutate and ifelse to fix the error, 
# recalculate decade, and then
# recalculate the responses from Questions 6-7 to
# find the correct oldest, averag-ist, and most recent songs


#ANSWER

ifelse(ds$song == "Brass in Pocket", ds$year == 1979, ds$year == ds$year) #MComment: I don't believe this updated without ds <- at the beginning
ds <- ds %>% 
  mutate(decade = (10 * floor(year/10)))
ds_sum <- ds %>% summarize(Average = round(mean(year)), Oldest = min(year), Newest = max(year))
ds %>% 
  filter(year == ds_sum$Newest | year == ds_sum$Oldest | year == ds_sum$Average) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  select(song,artist)

### Question 9 ---------

# Use group_by and summarize to find the average rank and 
# number of songs on the list by decade. To make things easier
# filter out the NA values from decade before summarizing
# You don't need to save the results anywhere
# Use the pipe %>% to string the commands together

#ANSWER

ds %>% group_by(decade) %>% summarise(AvgRank = mean(rank), NumberofHits = n())

### Question 10 --------

# Look up the dplyr "count" function
# Use it to count up the number of songs by decade
# Then use slice_max() to pull the row with the most songs
# Use the pipe %>% to string the commands together

#ANSWER

ds %>% count(decade) %>% slice_max(n, n = 1)
